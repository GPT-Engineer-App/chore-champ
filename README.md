# chore-champ

Please create a basic todo app with the following features:

- A header with the title "My Todo List"
- An input field where the user can type a new todo and press Enter to add it
- A list showing all the todos
- Each todo should have a checkbox to mark it as completed
- Completed todos should be visually distinguished (e.g. strikethrough text)
- A button to clear all completed todos

You can use placeholder todos for now. Use Chakra UI components where appropriate to create a clean and friendly look.
